Hello,

This project was created in three parts. The first part is "Main.java", which was written by Jacob Gordon. The second part is the single player pong
game "Ball1.java" written by Aldrin Brillante. The third part is multiplayer "Multiplayer.java" and was written by Lauryn


I wrote the introduction and menu screen in Main.java. I included a simple Vec2 class so I can be lazy, and a Ball class to "jump" around the screen.
The main class calls the other functions created by Aldrin and Lauryn. - Jacob

I was responsible for the Ball1.java class, which incorporated the attributes of the single player option on Jake's menu screen. 
Within the class, I created an AI opponent incorporated for the 'single player' option from the menu screen to be to be valid.
Thank you, Google - Aldrin
